# Project--ML-5

<table>

  **In this project we will build Decision Tree Regressor Model for predicting Classes based on different features in our dataset**.<br></br>

  Decision tree regression observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict data in the future to produce meaningful continuous output.<br>
  Continuous output means that the output/result is not discrete, i.e., it is not represented just by a discrete, known set of numbers or values.

  **Important-Note: Explore the dataset once before going through the code.**
